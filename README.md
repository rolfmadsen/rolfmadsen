# Search user interface based on FBI-API (FÃ¦lles BiblioteksInfastruktur), which is governed by KOMBIT

Full disclaimer: This project is being developed as I learn to program, so expect rookie patterns and errors.

This project is created with a Rust and serverless function backend and NextJS frontend while new code is deployed with every commit on Github to the Vercel cloud platform.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/project?template=https://github.com/rolfmadsen/rolfmadsen)

The discovery user interface is based on the [Danish Library Infrastructure Platform (FBI API)](https://fbi-api.dbc.dk/).

## Releasenotes

### October 2024
- Display detailed information about works, including titles, authors, abstract, publication dates, material types, subjects, and more.
- The page now dynamically fetches work details using the new api/work endpoint powered Rust matching the api/search endpoint.

### December 2023

- Rust backend with integration to FBI-API
- Access token is retrieved from the Access Platform
- Access token is reused for every API request in a browser session
- Request parameters are mirrored in the site URL
- Changes to URL parameters will initiate a new search request
- New search result page
- Skeleton screen for better perceived performance
- Piwik Pro integration for user analytics
- Introduction to the website

## Vercel (Zeit.co) - Next.JS

I use a very simple build pipeline where every commit to Github deploys the site on the Vercel cloud platform.

After committing code to Github you can se the build process under https://vercel.com/dashboard for the corresponding project.

# Preparing your local development environment

It has been a while since I had to reestablish my local development environment, and as the setup is estblished manually, view the following chapters as inspiration as they have not recently been tested.

## Ready your Ubuntu installation

I have installed Ubuntu on a laptop for my local development environment.

### Update nodejs to version 14 due to dependency on this version
```console
  curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
```
_Kilde: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#debinstall _

```console
  sudo apt -y install nodejs
```

```console
  node -v
```

### Install Git on Ubuntu
```console
  sudo apt update
```

```console
  sudo apt install git
```

```console
  git --version
```

#### Configure username and e-mail

Configure your name:
```console
  git config --global user.name "ENTER YOUR NAME"
```

Configure your e-mail-addresse:
```console
  git config --global user.email "GITHUB-USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com E-MAIL-ADDRESSE"
```
NB. Find your Github no-reply e-mail-adress under https://github.com/settings/emails. 

See configuration:
```console
  git config --list
```

### Install Vercel CLI:
```console
  npm i -g vercel
```

```console
  vercel -v
```

NB. When running $ "vercel -v" I got the response "command not found" and had to use $ "npm install -g npm".

## Github

If you clone this repository and setup a local development environment you can use the Vercel CLI to retrieve your environment variables using the "vercel env pull" command.

N.B. If you encounter the error message: "Error! The specified token is not valid" try "vercel logout" and "vercel login".

### Clone repository
Clone the code repository on Github to Github directory on your local development environment.

```console
  mkdir Github && cd Github
```

```console
  git clone https//github.com/rolfmadsen/rolfmadsen.git
```

Install all dependencies:
```console
  npm install
```

### Connect your local development environment to your Vercel project

1. Login (https://vercel.com/login) or create account (https://vercel.com/signup) on Vercel.
1. Create a new project (https://vercel.com/new).
1. Select "Add GitHub Org or Account".

Login to Vercel from terminal:
```console
  vercel login
```

Link local development environment to Vercel project: 
```console
  vercel link
```

Run project on localhost for testing before you commit changes to Github:
```console
  vercel dev
```

## Github - Personal access token

1. Open https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Add token name
4. Select scopes/permissions by clicking repo checkmark
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token to your preferred password manager
7. Open your terminal and navigate to local project directory
8. Remove old origin remote: 
```console
$ git remote remove origin
```
9. Add new origin remote: 
```console
$ git remote add origin https://{TOKEN}@github.com/{USERNAME}/{REPOSITORY}.git
```

### Adding a staging domain for testing changes

First set up Vercel to build a staging site when you push changes to your staging branch in your Github organization:
1. Open https://vercel.com/[ENTER YOUR ORGANIZATION]/rolfmadsen/settings/domains
2. Add "staging.[ENTER YOUR DOMAIN].dk"
3. Add "https://github.com/[ENTER YOUR ORGANIZATION]/rolfmadsen/tree/staging"

Create staging branch
```console
  git branch staging
```
Shift to staging branch
```console
  git checkout staging
```
Perform the changes you wish on the staging branch.

Shift to master branch
```console
  git checkout master
```
Add the changes made on the staging branch to the master branch.
```console
  git merge staging
```
Push the merged changes on the master branch to origin (Github master branch)
```console
  git push
```

### Commands for pushing code to github:

Stage all changes in the current directory and sub-directories:

Show status of working tree/directory and staging area:
```console
git status
```

Add or track all files from working tree/directory to staging area:
```console
git add .
```
NB. Add specific files by exchanging "." with the "file-name".

See the history of changes to the repository:
```console
  git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```
NB. You can use graph as an alias for the previous "git log" command via:
```console
  alias graph="git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"  
```

See the difference between working tree/direcotr and staging area:
```console
  git diff
```

Saves all changes to the local repository:
```console
  git commit -m "ENTER A DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGE" 
```

Upload all changes from the local repository to the master of the remote repository:
```console
  git push
```
NB. When you push you will be promptet to login to Github and you can use a Github Token for use as a password in the terminal under https://github.com/settings/tokens.

Get updates from remote repository:
```console
  git pull
```

Close staging branch

NB. Checkout master branch before deleting staging branch.

```console
  git checkout master
  git branch -d staging
```

# Piwik Pro ID and URL

[Piwik Pro Library for NextJS](https://developers.piwik.pro/en/latest/data_collection/web/frameworks/Piwik_PRO_Library_for_NextJS.html#)

1. Find the Piwik ID and URL under https://{account_name}.piwik.pro/administration/apps
2. Add Piwik variables to https://vercel.com/{account_name}/{project_name}/settings/environment-variables
